Tor Kitching

Filter (START)

-	Extract w/ 2-4% SDS buffer w/ protease inhibitor + sonication a/o beads a/o freeze thaw
-	Following current extraction procedure (V7)
-	Speed vacuum 750 µL to ~250 µL
-	Add ice cold acetone (4:1) for over-night precipitation to sample buffer w/ protein
-	Pellet
						
-	Add 400 µL ice cold acetone				** Care with pellet when pipetting
-	Spin + remove acetone
-	Add 400 µL ice cold acetone
-	Spin + remove acetone

-	Resuspend pellet in 20 µL 8 M Urea and dilute to 100 µL w/ Ammonium bicarbonate buffer (50 mM, pH 8)

									** SPEC in plate reader
-	Measure concentration of protein w/ micro BCA
-	Measure concentration of SDS (Stains-All procedure)

-	Continue w/ Trypsin digestion procedure for remaining sample for MS, reduction and alkylation
